What I hoped to accomplish:
My goal for this week was to get the item similarity matrix up and running.

What I did accomplish:
The matrix is coded and it runs. I do have some bugs to work out with information not mapping
to the correct data points, which can effect the overall recommendations but only marginally.
Since the program uses mutltiple data points to make recommendations, the small errors have some
but little effect on the overall program. 

I had hoped to get more accomplished this week but RStudio had other plans. My version of R is
throwing a critical error on startup and will not run code. Thankfully, I did not lose all of the code
I wrote but I do have to uninstall and reinstall R and all the necessary packages before I can
run/expand the code that I have.

What I hope to accomplish for next week:

For next week, I will be focusing on fixing RStudio, coding the user input sections and coding the GUI
