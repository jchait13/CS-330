What I hoped to accomplish:
My goal for this week was to clean all the data to be used in my book
recommendation engine including:
• Loading the dataset into R
• Choosing comparison metrics
• Removing unnecessary fields
• Splitting the data into the appropriate data frames

What I did accomplish:
The data is cleaned and ready to perform calculation for difference
and similarity. The overall process went faster than I anticipated but
I struggled with installing some of the packages needed for the
project (mostly – tidyverse) but loading the data into R was a quick
process once the packages were straightened out.

Subsetting the data into usable records took longer than I expected.
The dataset contains information for books that do not have any
ratings and therefore, there is not an overall rating. The item based
model is built on an analysis of the ratings and the genres, so the
incomplete records need to be removed to free up computing power.

What I hope to accomplish for next week:

For next week, I will be focusing on getting the item-product matrix
running. The math is straightforward but working on getting the
identification values mapped to the book titles will take a bit of
time and research. This matrix is the bulk of the project, so getting
it working by next week will allow for appropriate time to work on the
user interactive features and GUI.
