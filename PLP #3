What are the boolean values in your language? (e.g., True and False, true and false, 1, and 0,  etc)
The boolean values in R are TRUE and FALSE.

What types of conditional statements are available in your language? (if/else, if/then/else,  if/elseif/else). Does your language allow for statements other than “if” (for example, Perl has  an “unless” statement, which does the opposite of “if”!)? What operators are used to act on booleans?
R allows if/else if/if else statements and no additional ifs. 

How does your programming language deal with the “dangling else” problem? 

Throws an error - unexpected ‘else’’

If your language supports switch or case statements, do you have to use “break” to get out of  them? Can you use “continue” to have all of them evaluated?

Lastly, and perhaps most importantly: it is time to start thinking about what your programming project is going to actually be. In future sessions we will be breaking down your project into individual milestones for weekly check-ins. But for now, just write a short paragraph about what it is you are planning to code in your language of choice. Remember that it should be a substantial program - a game, app, calendar, web site, etc. (I'll try to dig up some examples to share before next class)
