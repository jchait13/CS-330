# Programming Language Project - Assignment #1

## History
**What is the name of your language?**

I will be using R programming language for this project.

**When/where was it created, and by whom? Was it written to address a particular problem or need?**

R was created in the early 1990’s by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman  at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. R is an implementation of earlier programming language, S. R was created to address the need for a user-friendly, interactive approach to statistical computing.

**What types of programming is your language primarily used for?**

R is primarily used for statistical analysis, statistical graphics generation and data science projects.

**Where will you get information about this language when it's time to start programming in it?** 
_At the end of your assignment, provide a list of the names of books, website, URLs, or any other resources that relate to your language in particular._

R is an open source language with resources readily available. The R Manuals can be found on the R Foundation website. Additionally, I will utilize the book “R Programming for Beginners: An Introductions to Learn R Programming with Tutorials and Hands-On Examples”

## Getting Started
**What did you need to do to install the language?**
Installing R was very easy. These instructions are for installing R on Windows.
1. Go to the [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
2. Select "Download R for Windows"
3. Select "Install R for the first time". This will download the R executable file.
4. Run the executable file to start the installation.
5. Allow application to make changes to your device & select installation language when prompted.
6. Follow installation instructions and finish! 

**Does this language come with a recommended programming environment? What is it? If not, how did you pick the one that you will be using?**

RStudio is the recommended IDE for R.

**How do you run programs in that language?**

RStudio allows you to run programs directly through the IDE with "Run the current line or selection" option that outputs to the console. RStudio also provides a Terminal tab that allows you to run programs using the command "Rscript" + the file name.R

**How do you write comments in your language?**

Comments in R are written with a hash before the comment. Example (#comment). This is the same way python comments are written.
